# Name_that_country
A fun quiz-game for learning countries

# Instructions
Very simple really. Press the letters and the country name gets typed! Hit 'Hard Mode' to hide the country name. Only the correct letterrs in the correct order will be accepted.

Mostly aimed at ages 5-10 with the idea of learning the country names as you type.

One caveat is that countries with spaces in their names are not included, as the space-bar automatically presses the 'next' button :(
